      <h1>Negev - my beloved weapon</h1>
      <p>
        The <abbr title="Internal Missle Initiator">IMI</abbr> Negev is an
        Israeli machine <b>gun</b> made by Israel Military Industries. The Negev
        in CS:GO is the commando variant, which has a shortened barrel, and the
        standard issue bipod was replaced by foregrip to improve mobility. The
        Negev is available for both Counter-Terrorists and
        <del>Terrorists</del> to purchase. Temporarily made unavailable in
        Competitive Matchmaking after the March 24, 2017 update, it was added
        back following the April 12, 2017 update.

      <h2>More info</h2>
      <p>
        The Negev carries a 150-round magazine, 50 more than the
        <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/M249">M249</a>, has a higher fire
        rate than the <del>M249</del>, and is significantly cheaper at $1700
        (originally, it had the price tag of $5700), compared to the M249's
        $5200 price tag. Like the M249, the weapon is heavy, has a long reload
        time, and has good penetration power. For the first 10 shots when firing
        continuously,
        <b
          >the Negev is extremely inaccurate, easily the most inaccurate weapon
          in the game when bursted</b
        >. However, the recoil pattern is unique in that after sustained fire,
        it concentrates on a point above the crosshair, with very little
        movement afterwards, allowing for very accurate continuous shots without
        much need for compensation. The weapon's movement spread is quite strong
        however, and the player is slowed down when firing (the only weapon in
        the game with this property), discouraging firing on the move.
